I was born a little over a year after the Chernobyl disaster and I grew up
around stickers like these.![Atomkraft Nein Danke](/atomkraftneindanke.jpeg)

Nuclear energy is not very popular in Germany. It's just normal to say it's
obviously bad and move on. Chernobyl, Fukushima, giant piles of nuclear waste
polluting our planet for tens of thousand of years, what's not to love.

For obvious reasons - the Gas and Climate sandwich crisis - I've been trying to
answer some obvious questions for myself: is this renewable transition actually
realistic or are we just lying to ourselves? What are we transitioning too,
exactly?

Of course public discourse is entirely devoid of details.

I started seeking out sources that had concrete things to say about nuclear
energy. This updated my priors quite a bit! I now consider it likely that we'd
be in a better place today had we invested more in this type of energy over the
last decades, and hope that we do so. I'm still actively looking for people out
there who can steelman an energy mix without nuclear for me.

An excerpt of reads I found notable follows. I keep reading and so I'm collecting
more of these, but probably won't go through the trouble of polishing them up as
I have done here[^24]

- Nuclear waste isn't as bad as I thought. I first came across this after I
  watched Chernobyl 1986[^1] which btw is fantastic. Simplifying dramatically,
  the really dangerous stuff decays relatively quickly, so unless (as happened
  in Chernobyl) you blow it all across the continent it is not as bad as one
  might imagine. (To be fair, what blew across the continent wasn't the waste
  but close enough). Also, what is called "waste" is actually still fuel, just
  needs the right kind of reactor.
- Chernobyl likely caused 300-500 direct and indirect deaths[^3].
- Fukushima is estimated as having caused 2314 deaths, however none attributed
  to radiation. Instead, they were largely caused by the evacuation of 160.000
citizens and the associated physical and mental stress[^3]. In particular, it
looks as though a more contained evacuation could possibly have saved lives[^21].
- Fossil fuels kill people at 820x the rate of nuclear (which has the lowest
  rate of all energy sources)[^4][^9]. Whether you like nuclear or not, so far
  it is the safest source of energy we have.
- I want to visit COVRA[^6]! When you hug the spent fuel casks you're getting
  less than background radiation because the cask shields you[^7].
- Nuclear isn't easy to build because it's hard to finance and even if you
  manage, the resulting energy currently isn't be cheap enough[^5]. That's
  largely why there isn't more of it.
- The first modular reactor design just got approved and they're trying to have
  one running by 2029[^20]. It will be interesting to see whether it will be plagued
by the delays and cost explosions commonly associated with nuclear projects. The DOE
has already spent $600M to make this one even make it this far.
- Germany spent close to half a trillion[^8] (!!) dollars on expensive gas this last winter,
  and on that budget you *can* build an entire generation of nuclear power plants... I know this because China decided to do just that ($440bn)[^10]
- Germany seems to be pretty dumb about energy. 
- I buy the argument that nuclear fusion will *never* happen[^18].
- I haven't read much about danger of nuclear proliferation but I'm sure it would be a concern if nuclear power plants went up all over the globe.

I have learned a bit about renewables and mostly have more questions now and,
not to belittle the indisputable progress deploying renewables, a bad feeling
about the overall trajectory we're on.

- There are some studies that show that renewables+storage could end up working
  out in terms of going CO2 neutral & not sitting in the dark[^13] but it's
  beyond my grasp, still looking for even just a basic explanation of how that
  might even pan out that way. A friend who has experience in the renewable energy
  sector in Germany tells me these studies underestimate the effort/political will
  it will take to decentralize the grid.
- How The World Really Works[^15] was an interesting read. Lots to criticize about
  the presentation and the pretty bogus claim to impartiality, but it makes a
  compelling argument that the majority of our dependence on fossil fuels is in
  areas not discussed much in public, and that there is no transition path yet.
- For example, how will we fix nitrogen to make ammonia? We burn gas today.
  Nuclear can do it well, but what else is in store if not that? Hydrogen,
  which we can maybe, maybe make via solar[^23]?
- Another example, Solar panels are made from polysilicons, and making polysilicons
  is extremely energy-intensive[^11]. Can we make and keep making lots of them
  *from renewables*, or is the plan to keep burning gas for those and offset the
  associated emissions? Or nuclear? Geothermal[^16]?
- Also note that in Germany, a solar panel rated for 100W produces an average of
  9W (due to nighttime, clouds, etc). 25% for the US due to the sunnier South.
  So if you put lots of energy into making one and they don't last forever, are
  they even a net benefit in most places?
- "Fun" fact, a solar panel turns ~80+% of incoming energy into heat, so if you
  covered, say, the Sahara desert with solar panels, you'd get some juice but
  also you'd really heat up the planet[^22]. Sad. Maybe that's how Andy Weir got the
  idea for Project Hail Mary[^14] though!
- Germany is good for wind![^12] 
- Climate Change and the Nation State[^15] helped me think of the climate crisis
  as primarily a migration crisis triggered by agricultural breakdown. It
  becomes a lot less abstract, and much scarier, that way. The book also points
  out that China has been taking Climate Change much more seriously (despite
  still burning lots of coal).
- More fun facts: by weight, roughly one forearm worth of you is ammonia that
  you consumed via food, and almost all of it was made by the Haber-Bosch
  process fueled by natural gas and atmospheric nitrogen[^17]. (The entire
  article is great).
- I really hope there's an adult in the room somewhere and humanity isn't just
  collectively pretending to be able to get off fossil fuels this century. I'll
  be very surprised if 2050 comes around and we're anywhere near carbon neutral,
  to be honest.
- Green Party's 2020 manifesto[^19] has only this to say about nuclear: "the
  climate crisis can be solved without this high-risk technology and world-wide
  existential threat to humanity". Solidly disagree on the "existential threat"
  part at this point, but still eager to learn what the plan actually is, and
  how the risk of the plan failing has been weighed against the risk of
  including some nuclear base power.
- Jack Devanney[^26] (very pro nuclear but also **very** qualified) makes the
  argument[^25] that intermittent renewables and nuclear are effectively in
  direct competition because if you have nuclear you're just not going to need
  renewables any more; and if you have intermittent renewables nuclear loses out
  to gas power plants. So it's between "no CO2 and nuclear" or "some CO2 and
  renewables".
