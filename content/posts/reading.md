Books of the last year or two. I haven't been very successful at reading
regularly, but given kids and work, that was to be expected[^1]. The list is
longer than I thought it would be.

## The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddartha Mukherjee

Fantastic book that surveys our understanding and treatment of cancer from
"ancient times" until today in a way that is gripping and accessible. Highly
recommend. I came across it as part of sampling from the [Pulitzer Non-Fiction
winners](https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/223).

Mukherjee was also on a podcast that I frequent
["promoting"](https://peterattiamd.com/sidmukherjee2/) one of his other books,
[The Song of the
Cell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321392-the-song-of-the-cell). I'm
sure to read that at some point, as well as his first book, [The
Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene).

## Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity by Peter Attia

I've been reading through the show notes of his
[podcast](https://peterattiamd.com/category/podcast/) for a few years at this
point so I was familiar with all of this and read selectively. There is little
in there that I disagree with and most of it is in line with what I do toady.

If you're not going to read the book, please exercise regularly including in a
way that builds muscle, care about your sleep, and talk to your doctor about
getting a lipid panel that includes ApoB and Lp(a).

## The Prize by Daniel Yergin

Another Pulitzer winner, sometimes called the "Bible on Oil", tracing the
history of the oil industry in the 19th and 20th century.

I came of age during the Iraq War and, at the time, while at the time I could
parrot that "the war was all about oil", I didn't really know anything, and
this was basically true until recently, when I read The Prize. The book is a
relatively quick read and still manages to explain the politics around oil of
the last hundreds of years in a way that allows the reader to understand the
motivations of each actor better, even today. Also, it is clear after this book
how helplessly dependent on oil we were then, and still are now.

## The Swerve by Stephen Greenblatt

Another Pulitzer, about the rediscovery of an ancient Roman text (On The Nature of Things by Lucretius). The book doubles, in part, as a biography of the Italian scholar Poggio Bracciolini and his discovery, in 1417, of the aforementioned work by Lucretius. Alongside, you learn quite a bit about Roman literary culture and interesting pieces of history, and also about society and in particular the Vatican in Bracciolini's times. I really enjoyed this book.

## [On Human Nature](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62555.On_Human_Nature)  by Edward O. Wilson

I viscerally agree with the premise of this book, which is - paraphrasing
heavily - that humans are animals first and foremost and many of their emergent
behaviors are best understood through that lens (rather than what humanities do
most of the time). A part of the book are intriguing descriptions of animal
behaviors. Unfortunately, the style of the book was a little draining to me,
and about half-way in it felt repetitive and not stimulating. It didn't help
that the premise of the book is a *defense* of the argument against a critical
audience, and some arguments were, to my taste, overly verbose (going through
dozens of Polynesian societies to make his point)

On human nature - wilson. Basic idea is that we should study humans and the emergent properties of their societies primarily as the smart animals we. Listened to the audiobook. Narration bored the hell out of me. Weird passive aggressive tone about “scientists not buying it” most of the time. I found the content compelling but after a while I felt like I had gotten the gist and the very detailed description of every idea were just more detail than I needed.
Neumann biography - man from the future
Guns germs and steel - had seen a bunch of summaries of the main ideas so I was surprised that my take-away from the book was a different one. The fertile crescent plus having large domesticable animals put us on the top pf the world.
Anatol nieven climate change and the nation state - frightening book and helped shift my thinking about climate change
Ministry of the future - didn’t finish, just so implausible
The deluge - really liked this one.
Plagues upon the earth
Betst and the brightest
Remains of the day
How the world really works - meh, it’s interesting to get the breakdowns on where our energy is actually consumed and how the consumption that get the most airplay (cars, etc) are only the tip of the iceberg. But Smil is sort of a downer type, doesn’t bring his own ideas, and it’s overwhelming with raw numbers that don’t give a lot of perspective. Didn’t finish this because you get the gist and after a while you feel that a bunch of pictures would’ve conveyed the message much more easily.
