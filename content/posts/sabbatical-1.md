I'm taking some time (a year!) off work these days. Typing this, I'm sitting on
the sofa at an AirBnB in South Lake Tahoe that has been our home for the past
five days, and keeping my three-year old company, who is, thankfully for the
first time on this trip, running one of her signature high fevers.

Morale is good, and everything went Better Than Expected (TM) so far: we
managed the "hauls" of the trip, flying from Frankfurt to Reykjavik end of
July, then on to Toronto, visiting Niagara Falls with friends from Ottawa, and
finally flying out to Reno (with an extended layover in New York City) to prep and shlep
our camping gear into what would be one of the
[muddiest](https://twitter.com/tbgrieger/status/1699458096693952888) Burning
Man events ever recorded.  There is a photo album of all of this which I'm
happy to share privately: just reach out. Now, we're on a much more flexible
schedule with a long-term rental car and won't have to board a plane until
November 8 (LAX to SJO in Costa Rica).

Going into the sabbatical, I had very modest goals on "side projects": none at
all. It's much easier to sustain a side project when in a routine at home,
where the kids are entertained by kindergarden or family for extended periods
of time. Travelling entails bidding goodbye to this comfortable support system
and much of one's personal time, and besides, I don't even set aside time for
side projects at home (unless staying healthy is considered one). But I do want
to get a little better at staying in touch with friends and acquaintances and
form new and tighten existing connections. I do OK (for a married man in their 30s anyway...) with my close
friends - I'll be on the phone with them at least every couple of months, or
spurt unsolicitated updates into long WhatsApp messages. But I think I am
missing out on some fun conversations with my "extended" network because I
rarely, if ever, pop up on anyone's newsfeeds and have little local network
(not that there is a "local" when travelling for a year anyway!). So few people
know what's currently on my mind, and there are likely missed opportunities.
Whenever I have a good conversation or an exchange with someone, I remember how
great that is. I want more of that in my life.

In the spirit of avoiding my usual pattern of overthinking what I put
out there and eventually backsliding into inaction, there's no closure to
this post. Instead, here are a few recent highlights from my browser history:

- [Why didn't we get a Malaria vaccine sooner?](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-we-didnt-get-a-malaria-vaccine-sooner)
- [Report on an Unidentified Space Station (short story)](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~kite/doc/roauss.htm)
- [Fatso (short story)](https://www.laweekly.com/fatso/)
- [How atmospheric CO2 actually warms the planet (tweet)](https://twitter.com/MarkusDeserno/status/1543326797382955008)
- [This guy really likes coffee (tweet)](https://twitter.com/simonsarris/status/1686917371959664640)

I hope to be back soon with more mundane updates and am happy to hear from you.
If you need an excuse to reach out, I turned 36 this week and I would love some
pointers to more fun short stories (thx Justin J for the idea).
