        Sabbatical Reading List: Linux x64 Exploits
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2017</span>

    <p>As a software engineer who (presumably) does their homework, one knows that
many things that make your program crash can also make your program
exploitable, and so naturally a lot of energy goes into avoiding those
conditions - don’t use-after-free, don’t leak variables from the stack, yadda
yadda.</p>

<p>But of course the other side of the coin - how to exploit mistakes when they happen - is
interesting in its own right and a great way to understand how computers
<strong>really</strong> work at a low level. Most probably have a basic idea - change the
return address to jump to code that syscalls and gives you a shell - but in
reality trivial attacks like this are rarely possible and one must use more
more and more sophisticated and quite creative tactics.</p>

<p>Wanting to look into this, I found a great primer for a deep-dive into the
real world of Linux exploits, as well as some “real” exploits to read up on.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s much more out there, and looking into some of the above is
likely to lead to hours spent reading up on random things. You’ve been warned.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the aptly named:</p>

<h4 id="linux-x86-exploit-development-tutorial-series">Linux x86 Exploit Development Tutorial Series<sup id="fnref:sploitfun"><a href="index.html#fn:sploitfun" class="footnote">1</a></sup></h4>

<p>Starting from the classic stack and heap overflows, this series of blog posts
by user @sploitfun quickly becomes more
advanced and addresses bypassing, among others, memory-based protection and
address randomization.</p>

<p>There really isn’t much else to say; it’s good, I think in parts because it’s
written by someone who knows what they’re talking about, but not to the point
of thinking everything is trivial.</p>

<p>Having read that, I went on to read up on real exploits which were dissected by
capable internet educators. Some favorites follow:</p>

<h4 id="the-linux-pi-self-requeue-bug-aka-towelroot-2014">The Linux PI self-requeue bug<sup id="fnref:requeue"><a href="index.html#fn:requeue" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, aka towelroot (2014)</h4>

<p>This bug in some past versions of the Linux kernel (until fixed in 2014) is in
the futex code. Futexes are <em>fast userspace mutexes</em>, and they are
tricky<sup id="fnref:drepper-futex"><a href="index.html#fn:drepper-futex" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The bug is, very roughly, that there is an operation
that moves waiters of one futex over to another futex, and that the
implementation of this operation didn’t deal properly with being handed the
<em>same futex</em> for both.</p>

<p>What it did in this case was allocate a list element which lives on the stack,
<em>expecting</em> that this element would be no more on the list by return time, due
to the way the code was supposed to work. But in that special, artificial case,
an early return meant that the list would now contain an element in memory that
was on the stack of that particular method call. Stack memory gets reused, and you
can set up function invocations that manipulate this list element’s pointers
such that when it’s deleted, a write in your favor occurs.</p>

<p>This and its implications (one way of rooting some versions of android) are
very digestibly explained online<sup id="fnref:towelroot"><a href="index.html#fn:towelroot" class="footnote">4</a></sup> on the <a href="http://tinyhack.com">tinyhack
blog</a>.</p>

<h4 id="stack-jacking---your-way-to-grsecpax-bypass-2011">Stack Jacking - Your Way To GRSec/Pax Bypass (2011)<sup id="fnref:stackjack"><a href="index.html#fn:stackjack" class="footnote">5</a></sup></h4>

<p>This is a blog post and associated slide deck from
<a href="http://infiltratecon.org">Infiltrate</a> 2011
which explicitly attacks Linux in the presence of grsecurity/PaX. What stood
out to me is how clearly the ingredients are defined and used; it’s not just
a magical chaining of steps that leads to magical outcome.</p>

<p>This is because it’s
not a <em>concrete</em> exploit: it’s an exploration of what’s needed to exploit
hardened Linux (the answer is that it’s very hard), and the folks at grsecurity
immediately reacted, so that all techniques presented are long dead<sup id="fnref:spender"><a href="index.html#fn:spender" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.
Still, it’s very instructive, and teaches you a fair bit about how the kernel
bookkeeps its processes along the way.</p>

<p>The basic ingredient they define is an arbitrary kernel write. This isn’t
something that happens every day, but does. However, note that
during the presentation, they simply compiled a kernel with an <em>intentional
bug</em> as a starting point.</p>

<p>This would be home free for a conventional Linux kernel, but under
grsecurity/PaX plus self-imposed extra assumptions (zero knowledge of address
space, with everything randomized, …), you have no idea where to write, and
what.</p>

<p>Where you eventually want to write is the credentials struct of the process (in
order to escalate privileges), which is reachable from the base of the process’
kernel stack; you need to be able to leak the base address to userspace and
that is often possible and the second ingredient<sup id="fnref:caveat1"><a href="index.html#fn:caveat1" class="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Then, to navigate to the creds struct, you need arbitrary reads, for which they
present two techniques (the simpler one simply uses the kwrite near the base of
the kernel stack to allow the process to read what it wants). And that is where
you write and win, using the first ingredient.</p>

<h4 id="chrome-exploits">Chrome exploits</h4>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2012/02/pwnium-rewards-for-exploits.html">Pwnium
competition</a>,
in recent years some attacks against Google’s Chrome browser have been
well-publicized and analyzed. The gold standard here is generally breaking out
of the sandbox, and while I don’t think I really learned too much fundamentals
from them, they make for excellent competence porn<sup id="fnref:competence"><a href="index.html#fn:competence" class="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For example, watch <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2012/05/tale-of-two-pwnies-part-1.html">Pinkie Pie chain
six different bugs to break out of the sandbox</a> or <a href="https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com.ar/2013/02/exploiting-64-bit-linux-like-boss.html">exploit a WebKit use-after-free bug for a coveted 64-bit
exploit</a>, awarded a total of $100.000 by Google.</p>

<p>Especially the second one is fascinating because it has to abuse the
use-after-free condition by carefully laying out and manipulating memory,
taking into account tcmalloc’s bucket sizes and where it will put the next
object - and all of that has to be done from JavaScript. It’s a bit like
watching a neurosurgeon who’s handed pliers go at it and make it happen.</p>

<p>Then, realize that <em>Pinkie Pie</em>, the author of the two exploits, was a teenager at
the time, and nod respectfully.</p>
