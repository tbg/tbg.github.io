      <description>I was born a little over a year after the Chernobyl disaster and I grew up around stickers like these.
Nuclear energy is not very popular in Germany. It&amp;rsquo;s just normal to say it&amp;rsquo;s obviously bad and move on. Chernobyl, Fukushima, giant piles of nuclear waste polluting our planet for tens of thousand of years, what&amp;rsquo;s not to love.
For obvious reasons - the Gas and Climate sandwich crisis - I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to answer some obvious questions for myself: is this renewable transition actually realistic or are we just lying to ourselves?</description>
